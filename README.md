I worked with Trevor Rice in this homework. We both collectvly
worked on this throughout the entire project. Observation on both
parts occured when away but neither wrote code without the other being
there, and the same for testing.
We just followed the book's algorithm. Some kids said they were successful
with implementing the hashmap with it, we however did not accomplish that.
We did have an issue in testing with a 100 case, it ran for 80 minutes before
Trevor killed the program and ran another new 100 case. This was while I was
gone due to leaving for class while he stayed in the lab and let it run.
