questions 5.8, 5.9, & 5.16




5.8
	a. Using PDF submitted with homework. The PDF 1st photo has
	all requirements
	up until part b.
	b.I felt better explaining my answer for b than writing and sending in
	PDF.
	The ?'s I would replace with a lower number than our terminals, meaning
	I would use at least a 0, since we are using a 1 for our terminal case
	when we win. I was confused if we were marking all of the cases that
	repeat, or just the first time they start repeating. I did the first
	time, either way they would still maintain a 0.
	c.I think the standard minimax can fail on a branch where the min is
	grabbed, and in my case it seems like eventually you would get a
	bad path with a possible loop, giving your minimax number the one
	you would not be interested in or at least the not optimal path to
	continue searching down.



5.9
	a.Possible games of tic tac toe
		A way to think I guess would be that there is 9 possible places
		to put a mark on the board then you would have to add each time
		just -1 due to losing a spot from the previous placements.
		So it would be 9!.BUT since you only need 3 in a row, and between
		two players the fastest way would be 5 marks on the board for a
		player to have won so you would only do 9*8*7*6*5 so about 15,000.


5.16
	b. You would not have to look at the 7th and 8th node due to the
	fact that we have seen a lower number than on the other side of
	our tree. so even if there is a lower we don't care.
	c.negative 1 to positive 1
