Due 11-2-17


6.1-
	COLORS 2 AND 4 DONE ON PDF
		2 = 30
		4 = 64
	If 2 colors were allowed there would be 0 ways to color the map
		so that no 2 colors are touching.

6.3-
	a.Originally I wanted to start with 1 word and build from that.
	where I went to a different idea is that I started realizing,
	eventually we will have all these words in colums per say and
	then we will be forced to find words that have to meet
	requirements to fit into their rows. Since that seemed extremely hard
	as it got more filled, it seemed better to go by letter. In what
	way though is where I got a little interested in this idea that we
	could do by first and last letter and length, choose words from
	that data collection and then it seems as we add more words, we will
	have more options. However I struggle between that idea and just
	creating words, one letter at a time. I feel you still run into
	similar issues with words that can fit. When I was young I remmber
	writing a crossword puzzle and the way I did it was by not limiting
	myself to the squares, rather I would build my words and around that I
	could add my blank spaces and seperators. That is why I originally
	was thinking we could just add a word, and then connect other words with
	it that would fit the bill.
	b.I think that this would require words, because how else would you
	know when you have a completed word and not some jumble of letters that
	will not be a word or possibly not even fill in the spaces, this is why
	i like the idea of using the first and last letter with words that
	are equal size. four/fair is what I mean, both 4 letter words that
	start with f and end with r.
