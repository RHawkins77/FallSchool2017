4.1

	a.Greedy Search - hill climbing search
	b.BFS
	c.first choice hill climbing, every time since t=0, all downward successors will be denied
		due to probability 1
	d.Random walk which may be considered similar if not equal to DFS.
		The reason we can say this is we have infinite choices and have no choice but to
		randomly grab one.
	e.if popluation size is 1, we will have to have only one parents, or an exact match. This means
		that we will make an exact copy of our 1 parent, meaning we should have less mutations, and
		to get those they would be randomly choosen so random search.
