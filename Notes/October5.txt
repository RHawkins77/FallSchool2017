-3sat

	-(a2, a27, a95)^

-Local Search
	-will not care about search path, just the goal state

	-The context
		-must have a way to compute some objective function
		 and means to alter the inputs to that function

ROYAL ROAD
	-imagine looking at a pyramid from above and walking the entire length in a square 	shape until you reach the to

hill climbing(greedy)
	-move a little and evaluate as you move up or take steps.

hill climbing ( stochastic)


hill climbing(first choice)
	-repeat until
		choose a random state
		if it is better go to it

	Simulated Annealing
		-i have a temp, and the move I make will depend on the temperature
		-so if temp is high the chance of making a bad move is better
		-So for S.A.
			-start at a high temp and slowly lower the temp
		Think about a ping pong ball bouncing on a board with 3 holes/dips
		in the board and we want it in a different hole, we want the deepest hole.
		As we get the ball into the deep hole we bounce less and the chances 
		of it bouncing out are lower

Beam search(greedy)
	Initialize a set S of k states
	takes best move from all and uses it

	Stochastic

	Genetic algorithm
	Initialize a set S of k states
	Reapeat until _____
		create child states by crossing over current states with probability 			______%
		Mutate child states with some probability _____
		Do one step of hill climb (optional)
		Drop low value states
